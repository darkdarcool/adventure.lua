A Lua Text Adventure Engine: Having settled on lua as a first 'real' programming language to teach my son I created a text adventure engine for him to code up some games. (He had a blast with MIT's Scratch and Lego's MindStorms.)

There are two complete, albeit short, examples for him / you to get started with. I am learning Lua as well and so far I love it. Since I am a beginner to Lua I am certain that I am not coding idiomatically; any suggestions are welcome.
